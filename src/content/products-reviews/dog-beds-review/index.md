Look for removable, machine-washable covers. This is non-negotiable for long-term use!

## How Often Should You Replace a Dog Bed?

Replace your dog's bed when:

- The foam no longer springs back
- There are visible tears or damage
- The bed has persistent odors after washing
- Your dog is avoiding the bed
- Support has noticeably decreased

Generally, expect to replace:

- Budget beds: Every 1-2 years
- Mid-range beds: Every 2-3 years
- Premium beds: Every 4-5+ years

## Final Thoughts

Investing in a quality dog bed is investing in your dog's health. A good night's sleep supports:

- Joint health
- Muscle recovery
- Immune function
- Overall well-being

Choose the bed that best fits your dog's needs, your budget, and your living space. Your pup will thank you with happy, restful sleep!
